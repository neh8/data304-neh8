Hello World!
This is my first web page.

Here is some text that I wrote. I used Visual Studio Code. I did not always like visual studio code. It has grown on me since I first used it a year ago. Out of the books we have read so far, I think I like Knaffic and Madden best. They ask good questions when they critique the graphs in the book, and their writing style is accessible. I can feel the disappointment in whoever created the graphics jumping off the page.

To show my (limited) experience with HTML code, here is a button that does nothing when clicked.
<button type = "button">Click Me!</button>
